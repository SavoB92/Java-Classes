What are variables?
Why we need variables?
How can we create variables?

1. Variables are containers or boxes in the memory that can the data for us.
2. Before we can ask the computer to do something for us we need to store the information and instructions in a file then we feed those to the computer and computer does that thing for us.
3. We need to tell the computer what type of box/container/variable we need.
   We need to give a name to the box.
